Valor
=====

To get started, open Valor.sln
Right-click the Project entitled "Valor Visuals" and select "Set as StartUp Project" if the project name is not already bold
Run!

If you're up to it, edit some stuff in the "app.config" file for the Valor Visuals project
(technically, you don't even need to recompile just from changes to the app.config file, which is why it's awesome to use for configuration)
